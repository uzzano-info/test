## Examples

To try a simple LangChain script, install dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the sample with your question (defaults to a Korean prompt if omitted):

```
python examples/langchain_sample.py "What is LangChain?"
```

Make sure the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is set before running. If it
is missing, the script will exit with a clear error message.
